# Project Title: “AI-Powered Legal Document Intelligence Assistant”
# Project Introduction:
Legal documents such as government bills, regulations, contracts, and compliance policies are often long, complex, and filled with domain-specific language. Understanding these documents requires time, expertise, and careful interpretation — a challenge for students, legal analysts, compliance officers, and general users.

This project presents an AI-powered Legal Document Intelligence Assistant, a complete end-to-end NLP system capable of:
1. Summarizing long legal or policy documents
2. Extracting named entities (organizations, laws, locations, dates)
3. Performing extractive, generative, and RAG-based question answering
4. Offering a conversational chat-style legal assistant
5. Classifying risk level of clauses (High/Medium/Low)
6. Supporting multi-model pipelines using both local and LLM-based engines
7. Providing a React frontend and FastAPI backend for an interactive user experience.

This project integrates multiple NLP tasks, fine-tuned transformer models, and retrieval-augmented reasoning, making it a sophisticated and realistic AI application suitable for legal, educational, and enterprise use.
