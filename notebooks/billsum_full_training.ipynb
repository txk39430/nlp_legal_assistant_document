SHORT TITLE.\\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Civil Rights History Project Act of \\n2009''.\\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds as follows:\\n        (1) A fundamental principle of American democracy is that \\n    individuals should stand up for their rights and beliefs and fight \\n    for justice.\\n        (2) The actions of those who participated in the Civil Rights \\n    movement from the 1950s through the 1960s are a shining example of \\n    this principle in action, demonstrated in events as varied as the \\n    Montgomery Bus Boycott, the sit-ins, the Freedom Rides, the March \\n    on Washington, the drive for voting rights in Mississippi, and the \\n    March to Selma.\\n        (3) While the Civil Rights movement had many visible leaders, \\n    including Thurgood Marshall, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and Rosa \\n    Parks, there were many others whose impact and experience were just \\n    as important to the cause but who are not as well known.\\n        (4) The participants in the Civil Rights movement possess an \\n    invaluable resource in their first-hand memories of the movement, \\n    and the recording of the retelling of their stories and memories \\n    will provide a rich, detailed history of our Nation during an \\n    important and tumultuous period.\\n        (5) It is in the Nation's interest to undertake a project to \\n    collect oral histories of individuals from the Civil Rights \\n    movement so future generations will be able to learn of their \\n    struggle and sacrifice through primary-source, eyewitness material. \\n    A coordinated Federal project would also focus attention on the \\n    efforts undertaken by various public and private entities to \\n    collect and interpret articles in all formats relating to the Civil \\n    Rights movement, and serve as a model for future projects \\n    undertaken in museums, libraries, and universities throughout the \\n    Nation.\\n        (6) The Library of Congress and the Smithsonian Institution are \\n    appropriate repositories to collect, preserve, and make available \\n    to the public a collection of these oral histories. The Library and \\n    Smithsonian have expertise in the management of documentation \\n    projects, and experience in the development of cultural and \\n    educational programs for the public.\\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to create a new \\nfederally sponsored, authorized, and funded project that will \\ncoordinate at a national level the collection of video and audio \\nrecordings of personal histories and testimonials of individuals who \\nparticipated in the American Civil Rights movement that will build upon \\nand complement previous and ongoing documentary work on this subject, \\nand to assist and encourage local efforts to preserve the memories of \\nsuch individuals so that Americans of all current and future \\ngenerations may hear from them directly and better appreciate the \\nsacrifices they made.\\nSEC. 3.

BUDGETARY IMPACT.\\n\\n    (a) Findings and Purpose.--\\n            (1) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\\n                    (A) the United States has substantial surface \\n                transportation and infrastructure needs; and\\n                    (B) this Act will result in additional spending \\n                from the Highway Account of the Highway Trust Fund to \\n                help address these substantial needs.\\n            (2) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to clarify \\n        that any budgetary offset necessary because of the additional \\n        spending provided by this Act should not come from surface \\n        transportation programs.\\n    (b) Sequestration.--The budgetary impact of the amendments made by \\nthis Act shall not be considered for purposes of sequestration under \\nsections 251 or 252 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit \\nControl Act of 1985 (2 U.S.C. 901, 902).\\n    (c) Discretionary Spending Limitations.--OMB shall reduce \\ndiscretionary spending limits for budget authority and outlays in \\naccordance with the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act \\nof 1985 for each applicable fiscal year set forth in section \\n601(a)(2)--\\n            (1) for budget authority, by an amount equal to the total \\n        amount of discretionary budget authority provided from the \\n        Highway Account of the Highway Trust Fund in the Department of \\n        Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1997; \\n        and\\n            (2) for outlays, by an amount equal to an estimate of the \\n        amount of discretionary outlays that would be expended from the \\n        Highway Account of the Highway Trust Fund assuming that the \\n        total amount of new budget authority and obligation authority \\n        from the Highway Account of the Highway Trust Fund equaled the \\n        amounts of new budget authority and obligation authority \\n        provided from the Highway Account of the Highway Trust Fund in \\n        the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies \\n        Appropriations Act, 1997.\\n\\nSEC. 6. STUDY TO ENSURE THAT THE HIGHWAY TRUST FUND IS DEFICIT NEUTRAL.\\n\\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\\n            (1) It is the policy of the United States Government that \\n        the Highway Trust Fund should not contribute to or reduce the \\n        Federal Government's annual budget deficit.\\n            (2) Under current budgetary scorekeeping conventions used \\n        by both the Congressional Budget Office and the Office of \\n        Management and Budget, increases in Highway Trust Fund revenue \\n        generated by tax increases are partially offset by a reduction \\n        in other Federal revenues that is equal to 25 percent of the \\n        increase in Highway Trust Fund revenue.\\n            (3) This 25 percent offset is a scorekeeping convention \\n        that applies to all excise taxes, and is not uniquely applied \\n        to Highway Trust Fund taxes.\\n            (4) An up-to-date examination of how this offset should be \\n        applied to Highway Trust Fund taxes is needed.\\n    (b) Report.--\\n            (1) In general.--Not later than 24 months after the date of \\n        enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Treasury, in \\n        consultation with the Director of the Office of Management and \\n        Budget, shall submit a report to Congress on ensuring the \\n        deficit neutrality of the Highway Trust Fund.\\n            (2) Contents.--In the report, the Secretary shall--\\n                    (A) determine the extent to which each of the taxes \\n                deposited into the Highway Trust Fund is a deductible \\n                expense from other Federal taxes;\\n                    (B) provide an estimate of the amount of Highway \\n                Trust Fund taxes that were deducted from Federal income \\n                taxes or other taxes;\\n                    (C) provide an estimate of the annual revenue loss \\n                because Highway Trust Fund taxes are deductible from \\n                other Federal taxes;\\n                    (D) determine the appropriate scorekeeping \\n                convention that should apply to Highway Trust Fund \\n                taxes, or if needed, separately to each of the taxes \\n                now deposited into the Highway Trust Fund; and\\n                    (E) provide the Congress with policy options that \\n                would ensure that changes to the Highway Trust Fund \\n                taxes do not contribute to the deficit.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3269,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Railroad Safety Improvement Act of 2005 - Amends federal transportation law to direct the Secretary of Transportation to establish an automated video image analysis pilot program in states with the highest rates of accidents at highway-rail grade crossings to record motorist violations at crossings equipped with automatic warning devices.
